      <h3>About ColorLyst</h3>
      <p>
        ColorLyst consists of Cat-city and Dog-town, born in Mansion Nami. Mansion Nami exists in the Matsumushi district near Tennoji, Osaka, and essentially serves as the core of Cat-city. Through collaboration with Dog-town, Cat-city can become Lizzo and Fishmans. 
        This is achieved by grilling meat and drinking Lipton milk tea. The shower water pressure is extremely weak, and the sunlight is also very poor. On the other hand, its tolerance for playing music at high volume is unmatched in Japan.</p>
      <p style={{margin:0}}>If you don't pass gas at an appropriate volume, you'll feel embarrassed even in the toilet (mainly due to the lack of doors).</p>
